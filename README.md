This is a fresh version of erlide, based on the Xtext framework. 

The main advantages of using Xtext are:
* we don't use Erlang for the IDE operation, making it more stable
* we get a lot of functionality "for free", tested and tried, just by being able to parse the files
* we can focus our efforts on Erlang-specific functionality

We estimate to have a working alpha during the summer and a beta with functionality equivalent to today's erlide in the fall.

Requires Eclipse 3.7 or later, Xtext 2.3.0 and Xtend 2.3.0
